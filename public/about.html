		<h2>first of all, thank you!</h2>
		By creating this site, I am expressing my belief that cooperation on a large scale is both possible and appropriate for the situation.  I have a lot to learn about these issues and industries, and I want to thank everyone who helps me refine my understanding of how best to interface with these users and how to address their needs.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<h2>secondly, here's how things work around here.</h2>
		The goal of this project is to help willing restaurants distribute their leftover food that would otherwise be disposed of.  Now, I suspect that if my favorite restaurants were in the habit of giving out ten meals each night at 2 am, I might find myself out there at the back door every so often.  On nights when I was bound for a late dinner anyway, I would probably still go to the dining room and pay, but I would at least be a little tempted to opt for the free meal.  In order to dispel that temptation, this service is premised on the idea that <em>only individuals who have been explicitly authorized are allowed to receive free meals</em>.  Each restaurant can choose which lists of patrons are authorized.  Also, individual patrons can be banned from individual restaurants even if they remain on lists that are authorized.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The intention is that only underprivileged individuals will be authorized, so the business of the restaurants should not be adversely affected.  Rather, the goal is to provide value that will improve the profits of establishments that participate.  So that restaurant employees do not have to spend any effort determining who is actually underprivileged, lists can be maintained by others, such as social workers or city officials, and restaurants can simply choose which lists they trust.

		<h2>why do I think this can work now, when it hasn't before?</h2>
		I am glad you asked because I am very serious about my reasons for believing that this initiative will succeed <em>because of the changes that have occurred in our country and, indeed, the whole world, very recently</em>.
		<ol>
			<li>People understand that <strong>wastefulness</strong> was one of the main factors that led to the squandering of the magnificent fortune our nation amassed over the past century.</li>
			<li>The diners that patronize restaurants are sensitive to the social impact that they and other establishments have on their communities.  Nearly all paying customers will see generosity towards the poor in a positive light.</li>
			<li>If participation reaches a substantial level, it will have an impact on the numbers of people who panhandle in the streets.  Or, even if they do continue to beg, at least we can be more confident that they're not going to spend it on food, and adjust our attitudes and donations accordingly.  This could have a nice impact on the quality of life.</li>
			<li>The fact that food is typically thrown out rather than distributed at the end of the night is a point of frustration for many.  Even small steps away from this policy will impact morale, for both employees and patrons.  This will eventually afford participating restaurants a little additional flexibility in setting their payrolls and their prices.</li>
			<li>This and participating organizations will be committed to the marketing and promotional needs of restaurants that participate in a meaningful way.</li>
			<li>The site will also serve as a directory for restaurants, listing phone numbers and other details that facilitate reservations and patronage.</li>
			<li>Someone who paid $100 for a meal is subconsciously tempted to think it tasted great, to preserve their own self-image as someone who spends their money wisely.  It is possible that chefs could obtain alternative feedback streams from authorized patrons.</li>
			<li>If there is sufficient interest in doing so, it may be feasible to make arrangements that would allow participating restaurants to treat donated food as tax-deductible.</li>
			<li>This nightly distribution might give chefs an opportunity to undertake small experiments with their recipes that they would not be ready to try in their dining rooms just yet.</li>
			<li>A slightly different tolerance for how much leftovers are acceptable would change the variables that dictate the schedule of food preparation in a way that might enable kitchens to provide faster service, garnering bigger tips while seating more people.</li>
			<li>Being underprivileged is stressful.  Alleviating the responsibility of searching out meals would give individuals more energy to focus on hygiene, skills, and relationships.</li>
			<li>As the economy changes, the number of people who cannot afford food is going to change.  Diminishing the burden on soup kitchens will allow available funds to be administered to the other needs that our society has.</li>
			<li>The need to avoid being banned will motivate individuals to be on their best behavior when in proximity to participating restaurants.</li>
		</ol>
