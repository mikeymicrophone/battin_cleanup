		<h2>how it works.</h2>
		<p>
			<span>The goal of this project is to help willing restaurants distribute their leftover food that would otherwise be disposed of.  This service is premised on the idea that <em>only individuals who have been explicitly authorized are allowed to receive free meals</em>.  Each restaurant can choose which lists of patrons are authorized.  Also, individual patrons can be banned from individual restaurants.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span>The intention is that only underprivileged individuals will be authorized, so the business of the restaurants should not be adversely affected.  Rather, the goal is to improve profits while efficiently providing value to the community.  So that restaurant employees do not have to spend any effort determining who is actually underprivileged, lists can be maintained by others, such as social workers or city officials, and restaurants can simply choose which lists they trust.</span>
		</p>
		<h2>secondly, thank you.</h2>
		<p>
			<span>By creating this site, I am expressing my belief that cooperation on a large scale is both possible and appropriate for the situation.  I have a lot to learn about these issues and industries, and I want to thank everyone who helps me refine my understanding of how best to interface with these users and how to address their needs.</span>
		</p>	
		<h2>why can this work now.</h2>
		<p>
			<span>I am very serious about my reasons for believing that this initiative will succeed <em>because of the changes that have occurred in our economy</em>.</span>
			<ol>
				<li>People understand that <strong>wastefulness</strong> was one of the main factors that led to the squandering of the magnificent fortune our nation amassed over the past century.</li>
				<li>More than ever, <em>consumers are sensitive</em> to the social impact that establishments have on their communities.  Nearly all paying customers will see generosity towards the poor in a positive light.</li>
				<li>If there is sufficient interest, it may be feasible to arrange for restaurants to treat donated food as <strong>tax-deductible</strong>.</li>
				<li>The fact that food is typically thrown out rather than distributed at the end of the night, and sometimes throughout the day, is a <em>point of frustration</em> for many.  Even small steps away from this policy will impact <strong>morale</strong>, for both employees and patrons.  This will eventually afford participating restaurants a little additional flexibility in setting their payrolls and their prices, making it easier to stay in business through tough times.</li>
				<li>This site will be committed to the marketing and promotional needs of participating restaurants.</li>
				<li>The site will also serve as a directory for restaurants, listing phone numbers, locations and other details that <em>facilitate reservations</em> and patronage.</li>
				<li>Being underprivileged is stressful.  Alleviating the responsibility of searching out meals would give individuals more energy to focus on hygiene, skills, and relationships.</li>
				<li>If participation reaches a substantial level, panhandling might reduce.  Or, even if they do continue to beg, at least we can be more confident that they're not going to spend it on food, and adjust our attitudes towards donation.  For those who should save their money, keep it without guilt.  For those who can afford to give, imagine the possibilities that a few dollars could bring to someone with a reliable source of food - a book, a toothbrush, a notebook, a cheap date.</li>
				<li>Someone who paid $100 for a meal is subconsciously tempted to think it tasted great, to preserve their own self-image as someone who spends their money wisely.  It is possible that chefs could obtain additional and <em>useful feedback</em> from authorized patrons who didn't know or care how expensive the food was.</li>
				<li>This nightly distribution might give chefs an opportunity to undertake small experiments with their recipes that they would not be ready or able to try in their dining rooms.</li>
				<li>A slightly different tolerance for how much left over food is acceptable would change the schedule of food preparation in a way that might enable kitchens to provide faster service, garnering bigger tips while seating more people.</li>
			
				<li>As the economy changes, the number of people who cannot afford food is going to change.  Diminishing the burden on soup kitchens will allow available funds to be administered to the many other needs that our society has.</li>
				<li>The need to avoid being banned will motivate authorized individuals to be on their best behavior when in proximity to participating restaurants.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h2>what about the government.</h2>
		<p>
			<span>There are laws that set conditions for when food can be distributed and when it must legally be disposed of.  Perhaps our government can be persuaded to reconsider the particular rules in place for the sake of the impact they could have on our economy.  Also, new technology will give us cheaper ways to test whether food has gone bad or contains unsuitable material.</span>
